I am currently pursuing my PhD at the [Chair of Pattern Recognition](https://lme.tf.fau.de/), FAU, Germany. My research focus is understanding and analyzing scenes in the field of digital humanities, with a major focus on Art-history, Classical Archaeology and Christian Archaeology. I apply existing state-of-the art methods to understand the artworks beyond object detection. My research interests are computer vision (CV), image processing (IP), machine learning (ML) and mathematics.

Before starting my PhD, I was a Machine learning Engineer at [InFoCusp Innovations Pvt. Ltd.](http://www.infocusp.in/), where I worked upon various projects involving research and development of products based on client requirements powered by ML. My role was to develop and test algorithms, mentor interns for the projects involving CV and natural language processing (NLP). Before leaving, I was also leading the in-house research project which focused on generating music sequences using deep learning. You can find the details of the projects [here](cv) 

I finished my Masters in Technology from [DAIICT](www.daiict.ac.in), Gandhinagar, India in Information and Communication Technology. My master's thesis titled, 'Deep learning based Super-resolution' was based on the first deep learning paper on super-resolution, famously known as [SRCNN](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/SRCNN.html). My bachelor's thesis titled, "Video synopsis and retargeting" was focused on compressing videos based on Hessian matrices.

In general, I have an experience of more than 6+ years in the field of image processing, computer vision and machine learning. I am fascinated by Mathematics in general and like to work around problems involving mathematics.
