Professional:

* July, 2016 to November, 2018, Machine Learning Engineer
* Where: InFoCusp Innovations Pvt. Ltd.
* Major Projects:
  * Anglr: Anglr Tracker is a device mounted on a fishing rod that automatically tracks every fishing
           activity into a digital logbook for a better fishing experience. My role was to observe,
           analyze and clean the data. After the data processing steps, I made various fishing activity
           detection models in python (for development) and C (for deployment) for various fishing
           activities and finally did verification and validation testing.
  * DeepDive: DeepDive was a project that involved visualization and understanding of Convolutional
              neural networks (CNN). The outcome of the project was an open-source tool called
              ['tf-cnnvis'](https://github.com/InFoCusp/tf_cnnvis) that helped users visualize CNNs in a
              better way. My role was to discuss and brainstorm ideas with the team. I used to help solve
              bugs and analysis once the ideas were developed.
  * SniperAI: Sniper AI is a tool using artificial intelligence for recruitment. It uses machine learning
              to match CVs and job specifications. My role was to design the algorithm, deliver then
              implementation solution and make it scalable for large amount of data for concurrent
              access to multiple users. I also designed and implemented an automated test-bench for
              objective evaluation of various algorithm metrics. I also did substantial manual testing
              on the developed algorithms for subjective testing.
