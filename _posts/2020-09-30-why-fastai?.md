This is my first blog post discussing about fastai, it's uses and why it's important for you as a beginner in machine learning to start using fastai. Let me tell you, you might be late to the party, but you won't be slow with fastai ;)

* Simple top-down approach
* Build products for applications

* Challenges 
    * Working with videos
    * Handling nighttime images
    * low-resolution images
    * speedy inferences for usefulness
    * **out-of-domain** data and **domain shift** in data over time
* Data Ethics
    * Questions to be asked: Given a situation (jury is yet to be out on ethical or unethical), How would I deal with it? What would I look out for?
    * Ask questions - understand the data flow and steps towards building a product/algorithm - Say NO if you find something is fishy.
    * Some data product design questions
        * What level of aggregation will you store data?
        * What loss functions, validation and training splits?
        * Focus : Simplicity OR Speedy inference OR Accuracy?
        * Challenges : Do you focus on out-of-domain data?
        * Should it be fine-tuned or train from scratch?
    * Recourse and Accountability [**Arkansas healthcare**]
        * blame-game - government and creator of the algorithm
        * data contains errors &rarr; audits and correction
    * Feedback Loops
        * YouTube story about pedophile recommendations &rarr; Build ethical metrics, maybe?
        * Using or rather selecting features that does not create the biases on metrics based on observations. Ex: Evan Estola's meetup idea
    * Bias
        * Historical, Representation, Measurement, Aggregation, Evaluation, Deployment
        * 
    * Disinformation
