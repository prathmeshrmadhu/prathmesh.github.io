While working at Infocusp Innovations Pvt. Ltd., I was one of the keynote speakers for Summer School on Deep learning organized by IEEE Student Branch, DAIICT. There were 200+ students attending this summer school.

I lectured on following topics:
* Linear and Logistic Regression
* Neural networks intuition
* Backpropagation Algorithm
* Convolutional Neural Networks
